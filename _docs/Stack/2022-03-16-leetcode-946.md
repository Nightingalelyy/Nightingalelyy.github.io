Description:


Given two integer arrays pushed and popped each with distinct values, return true if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4),
pop() -> 4,
push(5),
pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= pushed.length <= 1000
0 <= pushed[i] <= 1000
All the elements of pushed are unique.
popped.length == pushed.length
popped is a permutation of pushed.


Solution: 

Simulate the process of push and pop, then compare the number of instructions to the vector size, if equal return true.



Code: 

``` cpp?linenums
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        for(int x :  pushed)
        {
            pushed[i++] = x;
            // check that current pushed element matches with popped sequence
            while(i> 0 && pushed[i-1] == popped[j])
            {
                --i;
                ++j;
            }
        }
        // as pushed is a permutation of stack so at end it should be empty
        return i == 0;
    }
};
```
