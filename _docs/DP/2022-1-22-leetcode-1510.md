Description:
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer n, return true if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return false, assuming both players play optimally.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
Example 3:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>

Solutionï¼š

DP. we use dp[i] to show if alice can win when there are i stones, then we know that if dp[i]=false, dp[i+j<sup>2</sup>]=true.

Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        
        vector<bool> dp(n+1,false);
        
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            for(int j=1;j*j<=i;j++)
                if(!dp[i-j*j])
                {
                    dp[i]=true;
                    break;
                }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
        
    }
};
```
