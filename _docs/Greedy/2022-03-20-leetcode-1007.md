title: Leetcode-1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row

Description:

Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

 

In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)

We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.

Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.

If it cannot be done, return -1.

 

Example 1:
![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/14/domino.png)

Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.
If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated by the second figure.
Example 2:

Input: tops = [3,5,1,2,3], bottoms = [3,6,3,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
In this case, it is not possible to rotate the dominoes to make one row of values equal.
 

Constraints:

2 <= tops.length <= 2 * 104
bottoms.length == tops.length
1 <= tops[i], bottoms[i] <= 6

Solutionï¼š

Easy math problem, greedy, count the tops and bottoms to check if the problem can be solved.

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDominoRotations(vector<int>& tops, vector<int>& bottoms) {
        int n=tops.size();
        vector<int> countA(7,0);
        vector<int> countB(7,0);
        vector<int> same(7,0);
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            countA[tops[i]]++;
            countB[bottoms[i]]++;
            if(tops[i]==bottoms[i])
                same[tops[i]]++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<7;i++){
            if((countA[i]+countB[i]-same[i])==n){
                return n-max(countA[i],countB[i]);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
