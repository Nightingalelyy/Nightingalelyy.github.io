title: Leetcode-287. Find the Duplicate Number

Description:

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

Hashing to find the duplicate

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        vector<int> hash(n,0);
        for(auto x:nums)
        {
            hash[x]++;
            if (hash[x]==2)
                return x;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
