Description:

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

Solutionï¼š

Two pointers, goes from head and tail, swap each pair of them and meet in the middle of the String.



Code: 

``` c++?linenums
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        char *tail,*head;
        char temp;
        
        head=&s[0],tail=&s[s.size()-1];
        while(head<tail)
        {
            temp=*head;
            *head=*tail;
            *tail=temp;
            head++;
            tail--;
        }
        
    }
};

```
