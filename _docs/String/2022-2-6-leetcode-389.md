Description:
You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Solutionï¼š

Mask the String with their ascii, use the ans to remove the value of the string s, and add the value of string t, the final result is the word that added to the t.


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int ans=0;
        for(int i=0;i<s.size();i++)
        {
            ans-=s[i];
            ans+=t[i];
        }
        ans+=t[s.size()];  
        return ans;
    }
};

```
