title: Leetcode-438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Description:
Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
s and p consist of lowercase English letters.


Solutionï¼š

Sliding Window, check the sliding window from the head to the end of s, and the window size is the length of p


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution { // HashTable + Sliding Window
public: 
  vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
    int n = s.length();
    int l = p.length();
    vector<int> ans;
    vector<int> vp(26, 0);
    vector<int> vs(26, 0);
    for (char c : p) ++vp[c - 'a'];   
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
      if (i >= l) --vs[s[i - l] - 'a'];        
      ++vs[s[i] - 'a'];
      if (i >= l - 1 && vs == vp) ans.push_back(i + 1 - l);
    }
    return ans;
  }
};
