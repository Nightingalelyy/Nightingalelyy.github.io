Description:

Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.

The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

"()" has score 1.
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 50
s consists of only '(' and ')'.
s is a balanced parentheses string.


Solutionï¼š

We define the element depth as ((( ))) has the depth of 3
then every depth has the score pow(2,depth)



Code: 

``` c++?linenums
class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfParentheses(string s) {
        
        int dep=0;
        int res=0;
        
        char prev='(';
        
        for(auto c:s)
        {
            if(c=='(')
                dep++;
            else{
                dep--;
                if(prev=='(')
                    res+=pow(2,dep);
            }
            prev=c;
        }
        return res;
    }
};

```
