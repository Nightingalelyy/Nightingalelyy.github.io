title: Leetcode-133. Clone Graph

Description:

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:
![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/04/133_clone_graph_question.png)

Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
Example 2:

![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/07/graph.png)
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
Example 3:

Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

Solution:

Graph Algorithm, use the adjacent list to rebuild the graph


Code: 

``` c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    vector<Node*> neighbors;
    Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = vector<Node*>();
    }
    Node(int _val, vector<Node*> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
public:
    Node* cloneGraph(Node* node) {
        
        if(!node)
            return nullptr;
        
        vector<Node*> vis(101,nullptr);
        queue<Node*> q;
        
        Node* node1=new Node(node->val);
        vis[node->val]=node1;
        q.push(node);
        
        while(!q.empty())
        {
            Node* p=q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            for(auto x:p->neighbors)
            {
                if(vis[x->val])
                {
                    vis[p->val]->neighbors.push_back(vis[x->val]);
                }
                else
                {
                    Node* t=new Node(x->val);
                    vis[x->val]=t;
                    vis[p->val]->neighbors.push_back(t);
                    q.push(x);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return node1;
        
    }
};
```
