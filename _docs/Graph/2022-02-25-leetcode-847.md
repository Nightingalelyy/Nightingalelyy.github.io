Description:

You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected with node i by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may reuse edges.

 

Example 1:
![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest1-graph.jpg)


Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0],[0],[0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [1,0,2,0,3]


Example 2:

![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/12/shortest2-graph.jpg)

Input: graph = [[1],[0,2,4],[1,3,4],[2],[1,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible path is [0,1,4,2,3]

Solution:

BFS on the graph, use bitmask to mask the points.


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
  int shortestPathLength(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
    int n = graph.size(),res = 0;
    queue<tuple<int,int,int>> q;
    vector<vector<int>> seen(n,vector<int>(1<<n));
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        q.push(tuple<int,int,int>(i,1<<i,0));
        seen[i][1<<i] = true;
    }
    while (!q.empty())
    {
        auto [idx,mask,dist] = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if(mask==(1<<n)-1){
            res = dist;
            break;
        }
        for(auto v:graph[idx]){
            int mask_v = mask|1<<v;
            if(!seen[v][mask_v]){
                q.push(tuple<int,int,int>(v,mask_v,dist+1));
                seen[v][mask_v] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
};
```
