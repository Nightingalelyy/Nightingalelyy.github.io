Description:

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
 

Example 1:

![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true



Example 2:
![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
 
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
-10<sup>4</sup> <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10<sup>4</sup>

Solutionï¼š

Very similar to Binary Search Tree, since there is priority in the matrix, we can traversal the matrix like to traversal a binary search tree.


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
        int rows = matrix.size(), cols = matrix[0].size(),
            row = 0, col = cols - 1;
			
        while (row < rows && col > -1) {
            int cur = matrix[row][col];
            if (cur == target) return true;
            if (target > cur) row++;
            else col--;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
};
