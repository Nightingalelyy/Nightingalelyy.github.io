The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer num, return its complement.

Example 1:

Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
Example 2:

Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.


Solutionï¼š

There are built-in methods provided by languages such as __builtin_clz in C++ which counts leading zeros, highestOneBit in Java which returns the number with only its leftmost bit set and so on... These methods can be used to solve this problem.

Code: 

``` c++

class Solution {
public:
    int findComplement(int num) {
        return ~(-1u << (32 - __builtin_clz(num))) ^ num;

    }
};
```
