Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

Solutionï¼š

For any number n, n xor n=0

therefore, for the whole array, xor every nums in it, the result is the single number.


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) { 
       int ans=0;
	   for(auto x:nums)
	   ans^=x;
	   return ans;
    }
};
```
