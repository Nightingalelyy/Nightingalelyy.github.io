Description:

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:

![enter description here](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104


Solution:

Easy Simulation, imagine that pour the water from upside, use two pointer to point the left and right walls, if the water is full, remove the short wall, renew the answer if larger.


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int l=0;
        int r=height.size()-1;
        int dep=0;
        int res=0;
        while(height[l]>=dep && height[r]>=dep)
        {
            dep++;
            while(height[l]<dep && l<r) l++;
            while(height[r]<dep && l<r) r--;
            if(l>=r) break;
            res=max(res,(r-l)*dep);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
