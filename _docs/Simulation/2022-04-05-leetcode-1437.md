Description:

Given an binary array nums and an integer k, return true if all 1's are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_1_1791.png)
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
Example 2:
![enter description here](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)

Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
0 <= k <= nums.length
nums[i] is 0 or 1


Solution:

Easy Simulation.


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool kLengthApart(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        
        int count=k;
        
        for(int x:nums)
        {
            if(x==1)
            {
                if (count<k)
                    return false;
                count=0;
                continue;
            }
            count++;
        }
        
        return true;
        
    }
};
```
