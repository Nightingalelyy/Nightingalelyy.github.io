Description:
You are given an array representing a row of seats where seats[i] = 1 represents a person sitting in the ith seat, and seats[i] = 0 represents that the ith seat is empty (0-indexed).

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to the closest person.

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots.

Given an integer array flowerbed containing 0's and 1's, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty, and an integer n, return if n new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

 

Example 1:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

Math Problem


Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int zeros = 1, ans = 0; // Easier handling of prefixes, just initialize zeros to 1
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.size(); i ++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                ++ zeros;
            } else {
                ans += (zeros - 1) / 2;
                zeros = 0;
            }
        }
        return ans + zeros / 2 >= n; // Note that suffix zeros need not -1
    }
};
```
