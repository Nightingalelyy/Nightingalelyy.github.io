Description:

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 100


Solutionï¼š

Two pointers, fast pointer and slow pointer, while fast pointer moves two steps, slow pointer moves one, when fast pointer reach the end of the list, the slow pointer pointing at the middle of the list.


Code: 

``` c++

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* middleNode(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* slow = head;
        ListNode* fast = head->next;
        while(fast){
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
            if(fast) fast = fast->next;
        }
        return slow;
    }
};
```
