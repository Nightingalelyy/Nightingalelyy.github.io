Description:

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

The town judge trusts nobody.
Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]

Output: 2

Example 2:


Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]

Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]

Output: -1


Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= trust.length <= 10<sup>4<sup/>

trust[i].length == 2

All the pairs of trust are unique.

ai != bi

1 <= ai, bi <= n

Solutionï¼š

Use hash table, ++trusted[num2],--trusted[num1]
therefore when one people trusted someone, his trusted number will not be n-1 even if other people are all trusted in him.



Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int findJudge(int n, vector<vector<int>>& trust) {
       
         
        ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
        cin.tie(NULL);
        int trusted[1001];
        memset(trusted,0,sizeof(trusted));
        
        for(auto i:trust)
        {
            trusted[i[0]]--;
            trusted[i[1]]++;
            
        }
        for(auto i=1;i<=n;i++)
            if (trusted[i]==n-1)
                return i;
        return -1;
    }
};
```
