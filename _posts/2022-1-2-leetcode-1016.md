Description:

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.


Example 1:

Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3

Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:

(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180

(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120

(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

Example 2:

Input: time = [60,60,60]

Output: 3

Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.




Constraints:

1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10<sup>4</sup>

1 <= time[i] <= 500

Solutionï¼š

As the constraints is from 1 to 6 * 10<sup>4</sup>
it will be time exceeded using the calculation of O(N<sup>2</sup>)


That means we need to solve this problem by using hash table.

if a song is divisible of 60, ++hash[0] else ++hash[60- time % 60]


e.g. if a song last 49, it will be divisible of 60 if it plus to the song which remainder of 60 is 60-49=11



Code: 

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        
        int ans=0;
        
        int n=time.size();
        
        int hash[61];
        memset(hash,0,sizeof(hash));
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            int remainder=time[i] % 60;
            
            if(remainder==0)
                ans+=hash[0];
            else
                ans+=hash[60-remainder];
            
            hash[remainder]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
